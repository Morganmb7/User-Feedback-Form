This repository features an interactive user feedback form designed using event-based programming in JavaScript. The project captures and responds to user input through dynamic DOM manipulation and event handling techniques. Key features include real-time character counting, tooltip displays, responsive input validation, and form behavior controlled through bubbling and delegation. Additionally, mouse movement and keyboard events are used to enhance interactivity and create a more engaging user experience. This project demonstrates a hands-on understanding of event-driven programming and showcases the ability to build responsive, user-friendly interfaces using JavaScript.
